# React + TypeScript + Vite

Basic template for React using TS and Vite.

This template provides:

- the option to add internationalization (default ones are english, german and french).
- a settings page (with the option to change languages)
- the possibility to switch between dark and light theme
- store logic (using [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)) & more

Happy coding!
